# Lab 5

## Problem 0

Our github repo is https://github.com/patryciaskora/MA350Lab5.git. I'm working on RStudio on my personal computer and Taylor is working on RStudio Cloud. 

## Problem 1
```{r}
x <- c(2.2, 7.8, -4.4, 0.0, 1.2, 3.9, 4.9, -5.7, -7.9, -4.9, 28.7, 4.9)
quantile(x)
```

The first quartile is -4.525 and the third quartile is 4.9. The interquartile range is Q3 - Q1 which would be 4.9 - -4.525 = 9.425.

## Problem 2
```{r}

```
